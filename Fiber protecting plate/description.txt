This plate is designed to protect fragile optical fibers, ie. fiber Bragg gratings.
The fiber should be placed between two walls and secured with sponge or gasket compressed with the cover.
If the fiber has spliced-in fiber pigtail, the pigtail should be secured with sticky tape through the slots
in the base.

The plate can have mesh to lower the weight and use of plastic. The holes can be circular or hexagonal.
The cover can be secured to the base with screws. The number of screws can be customized.
The screws can go into either inserts or hex nuts.

STL available on Printables [ I need the points ;-) ]
